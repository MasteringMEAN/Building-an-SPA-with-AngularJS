			<h1>Building Single Page Web Apps with AngularJS</h1>
			
			<h3 style="color: #FA8D11"> Deep dive into the key aspects of building SPAs using AngularJS</h3>
			
			
	<p>		
  
  
  This course will take you from the very basics of developing rich client-side Single Page Applications (SPA) through a series of practical examples of incremental complexity, including a full review of AngularJS’ built-in features and testability features.
 <br><br>
At the beginning of the course, you will be introduced to the advantages and limitations of AngularJS and its compatibility with SPAs. As we move on, we'll dive head-first into the application coding, starting from your first application and going all the way from building a to-do list app to a fully featured movie database, understanding every key aspect of the framework in the process. Later on, we'll focus on reviewing AngularJS' built-in components (directives, filters, and services) including every detail of how to write your own custom components of every kind. And finally, we'll wrap up with automated testing clearly guiding you on how to write and execute automated tests on AngularJS and introducing best practices on both unit and end-to-end testing.
 <br><br>
<i>Building Single Page Web Apps with AngularJS</i> will take you from zero to hero, covering all important aspects of the framework and preparing you to hit the ground running on any single page application.
